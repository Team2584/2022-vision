# Flir Camera Tests

This is my attempt to use apriltags with the Flir camera.

The code here is basically just me mashing together the examples/opencv_demo.cc code from the apriltag library
with the Acquisition/Acquisition.cpp example code that comes with the Spinnaker SDK.

As of now (the initial commit) the numbers for pose detection are nonsense.
